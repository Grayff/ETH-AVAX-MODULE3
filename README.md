## WINXCLUB Token (WNXC)

## Overview

WINXCLUB Token (WNXC) is an ERC20-compliant token built on the Ethereum blockchain. It inherits functionalities from the standard `ERC20` token, as well as the `ERC20Burnable` extension and the `Ownable` contract.

## Smart Contract Details

- **Name:** WINXCLUB
- **Symbol:** WNXC
- **Decimals:** 18

## Requirements

- Solidity Compiler: ^0.8.9

## Deployment

To deploy the WINXCLUB token contract, follow these steps:

1. Install necessary dependencies:
   - "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol"
   - "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol"
   - "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol"

2. Compile the Solidity contract (Lock.sol) using a compatible compiler (0.8.9 or higher).

3. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a compatible Ethereum wallet or development environment.

4. Once deployed, the contract owner can call the `mint` function to mint new WINXCLUB tokens and add them to the total supply. Only the contract owner has the authority to mint new tokens.
